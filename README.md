## Functional

1. [x] Users could be authenticated anonymously, no need to take a phone number or email. Upon first installation the app should ask for their name.
2. [x] The application should track the user footsteps and update them in real-time, meaning while the app is in the foreground, and the user walks around, they should be able to see the steps counter increasing.
3. [x] For each number of footsteps taken, a function must run to exchange it to “Health Points”, e.g., 100 footsteps = **1 Health Point**.
4. [x] There should be a history that lists all the exchanges that happened by date and time (*g., “+10 health points on 24 April, 12 AM”),* along with any redemption (e.g., *“-120 health points spent at Starbucks on 25 April, 4 PM”*).
5. [x] Show a visual feedback **(e.g., Snack bar)** when users gain extra points.
6. [x] There should be a catalog of rewards so users can pick a **reward** they like and redeem it. Each reward is linked to one **partner** (e.g., 150 SAR off on Digital Watches from Jarir, or 1 free large coffee at Starbucks).
7. [x] Rewards are paid with health points, feedback should be given upon all cases: if the redemption can happen, show a confirmation dialog, if it cannot due to a low number of points, show an error message stating clearly what’s wrong.
8. [x] ✨ (Bonus!) There is a leaderboard page where the user can see their ranking (how many steps they have made since installing the app) compared to all other users, to encourage them to walk more.
9. [ ] ✨ (Bonus!) If the application is in background, or turned off, the exchange will happen while they are walking, and a notification would be sent from the app telling them that they gained extra points.
10. [x] ✨ (Bonus!) The app is multilingual, supports both Arabic and English.

## Non-functional requirements

1. [x] Usable and user-friendly interface.
2. [x] Follow [Material design](https://material.io/) on Android, and ✨ (Bonus!) Cupertino on iOS.
3. [x] Use a proper architecture for the code, UI code must not include any DB queries or business logic.
4. [x] Use clear models for data.
5. [x] Document functions and provide meaningful variable names and follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) to write your code.
6. [x] ✨ (Bonus!) Dark mode.
7. [x] ✨ (Bonus!) Privacy and security (e.g., Firestore database rules).
8. [x] ✨ (Bonus!) The project is [null-safe](https://flutter.dev/docs/null-safety).
